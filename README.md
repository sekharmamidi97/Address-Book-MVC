# Address-Book-MVC

## **Description**
This is a web application that allows a user to enter a variety of information and populates that information into a database. The information that 
a user can enter includes such things as their names (first, middle, and last), professional title, age, addresses (home, work, other),
phone numbers (home, work, mobile), email addresses (personal, work, other), social media accounts (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook), and 
website(s).  The only required fields that a user must enter include his/her first and last names, age, home address, and home phone number. Once
a user enters his/her information, it will then populate it into a database. 

##**Motivation**
The purpose behind this project was to practice several skills including creating models, views, controllers (MVC), HTML, CSS, and using data access layers (DAL)
to communicate between Visual Studio and SQL Server in order to populate the database.  I included only one method in the application
because I wanted to make sure that the entered information would appropriately populate the database.  I also incorporated an integration test to
make sure that the code in Visual Studio interacting appropriately with the database in SQL Server.
